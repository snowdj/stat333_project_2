I was told over the phone that the Cod fish fry was $15.

In person we were told the Cod cost $16 and the Bluegill was $18.

When the bill came I was informed that the Cod was $18. For one lousy piece of Cod.

Why were we so stuffed? We started with an order of  farmer's vegetables and an order of spaetzle. The vegetables were $5 and really good - a saut√©ed medley of cauliflower, Brussel spouts, beets, zucchini, and onions. The Spartzle was really good - as good or better than anything I had on a recent trip  to Germany. The rolled were crusty with a hint of sourdough.

4,1847 At the Stamm House,"We tried the relaunched Stamm House last night for the first time. They were recently closed for several months to redo their menu, and they've transitioned to more of a supper club concept. The building is charming and historic. We were seated upstairs. It was fairly busy, but not too noisy. We were given a wine and beer list, and I looked for cocktails. None were listed, so I asked our server if they had any special cocktails. He said ""not until next week,"" which I found kind of odd. They have their liquor license, and I saw other customers with drinks. I was hoping he could recommend something to me, but I ended up just getting a beer. As we waited for our food, I noticed other tables around us all had bread baskets. I asked our server if bread baskets were available, and he said ""yes,"" then there was a long pause, and he asked ""did you want one?"" Well, yes, that's why I was asking about it. It was not delivered until our entrees came out. We had two pepper shakers on the table and no salt shaker, and our candle was unlit until the end of our meal (other tables all had lit candles). Despite the iffy service and mysterious lack of cocktails, the food was a true highlight. I ordered the hashbrown encrusted walleye, which came with delightfully seasoned and fresh green beans. I also had the side of brussel sprouts and bacon, which was both sweet and savory. My husband had the burger, which he enjoyed. I would definitely order the walleye again. Overall, this restaurant shows real promise, despite the kinks in service. We'll visit again for the food (and hopefully cocktails!), and I hope in the mean time they'll work on smooth service.

3,1847 At the Stamm House,"I had high hopes that these guys would do right on their recent do-over.  Sadly this is not the case.  We went on a typical mid-week night - they had a good crowd but were far from crowded.  We were told we could sit at the upstairs bar, but when we went there, ""no there's no bartender up here"".  Ok so we found a seat at the downstairs bar we were immediately told by the bartender that he would be right back - before he even said hello or here is a bar menu.  He gave us the latter when he returned, them disappeared again, suffice it to say he was overworked by an average sized crowd.  A good bartender could have managed it.  He could not. We asked for a cocktail menu, ""we aren't doing that yet"".  Ok.  The one good thing about the previous rendition was they had good drinks and good 'tenders.  On to dinner. The place is still pricey though they added a cheap burger and a spendy brat ($8!). The hash brown crusted walleye was very good.  The ribeye (that is more like a filet) was slightly more rare than it should have been and tough.  The lack of marbling made it less than flavorable....so why not dress it up with the brandy peppercorn topper?  It was awful.  Tasted like a brown sauce from Perkins with the added dimension of too many whole peppercorns to make it a serious problem to eat without gagging.

2,1847 At the Stamm House,"I've been to 1847 at the Stamm House five times. I kept returning because, while none of the meals was perfect, each time there was something that I really liked: the crispy, golden frites; the warm bread served with homemade butter; the fish fry (the first time I had it, not the second). I kept hoping that the disappointing aspects would be ironed out or improved over time. My fifth visit was this past weekend, and I'm disappointed to report that it was the worst one yet. Where was the delicious bread and butter? And what happened to the frites--these ones weren't golden or crispy at all; they were gray and soggy. I was optimistic about the fish fry because there was now the option of ordering baked or fried, but the baked whitefish was weird. My husband's Lamb Bolognese had an ice-cold pocket in the middle, as if it had been (poorly) microwaved. Our meal overall wasn't remotely worth the $100+ it set us back. We left wishing we had gone to the Free House instead, and spent half the money for better food.

The fish fry is perch either fried or pan fried. It was good but the tartar sauce and shrimp sauce was terrible. The white stuff was mayo with some pickle relish in it and the shrimp sauce nothing more than catchup with some horseradish mixed in. What is so hard about making these two things like they do at all of the good fish places? It makes the meal. There was no love in the making of these. A side of brussels sprouts was five bucks but very good. Perfectly cooked with some bacon which made it very tasty. Mashed potatoes, if you order it instead of fries was cold but eatable. It was pricy. Either 21 or 25 bucks, I can't remember,  makes it a fish fry I won't be coming back to. Another pet peeve of mine is the table water. It had that old potato taste that comes from either a dirty ice machine or dirty water filters. Lots of people don't notice this like my wife but I sure do. The service this night was excellent and the two deserts that were ordered were very good I was told. I did not eat any. The other two choices for fish was a smelt basket and hash brown crusted Walleye which didn't appeal to me. All in all the place looks nice and I hope they make it this time with the new chef and better service. For the price of the fish fry it was not worth it to me.

Great place for dinner, check the menu as it does change seasonally - which in my opinion is nice. The chief does have a great sense of flavor and it tends to be a bit more modern than is usually found in Madison. I remember some excellent lamb meatballs from last fall that were seasoned beautifully with all sorts of spices (yum! I often find food in the mid-west bland). 
the servers and bartenders are great - they definitely measure out your drinks, but then often they'll add a tiny bit extra so you don't feel like they are too stingy.

In short, a great place to hang out, the only improvement I could make would be to reverse the parking and the patio (move parking to the front and patio to the back), but overall, a great place, worth the money (yes it is on the upper end of the Middleton dining scale), and a generally enjoyable experience.",2016-07-26,1,0,0,Middleton,-89.494781,43.104085999999995,"['Restaurants', 'American (New)', 'French', 'American (Traditional)', 'Supper Clubs', 'Gastropubs']",1024,72,2.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,45.0,27.0,24.0,17.0,32.0,1.0,1.0,80.0,8.0,16.0,12.0,23.0,7.0

Hidden secret is the 2nd floor bar. Almost always space available when everything else is full. Best patio in Middleton...full service anywhere you want to sit. Also, patio and bar is always first come, first serve.

The drink menu is very creative, progressive and fun without being pretentious. Both bars are impressive to sit at although there are only tv's downstairs that are turned on by request. The Finn's #7 is the hero of the drink menu for sure. The Northwoods Sazerac is my favorite though. Boozy but delicious. Also, great selection of craft beers on tap and a progressive and impressive wine list. Very reasonably priced bottles.

Menu is a modern take on classic supper club options. Fish fry is high quality whitefish from Lake Superior...chicken and dumplings on Wednesdays and a steak for 2 on Saturdays. Everything is a la' carte and for the most part generous portions.

Beet Carpaccio and Heirloom Tomatoes are must try starters...Meatballs look delicious as well. Also has a cheese board and charcuterie option. 

Lake Trout and roasted chicken were solid and the grass fed burger was fantastic.

All the desserts are homemade and not too big...Lemon Olive Oil Cake and Salted White Chocolate Pudding were my favorites. 

Also have some delicious dessert wines that our server recommended to accompany the dessert.
